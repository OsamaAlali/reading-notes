##One-to-One Relationship

Two entity classes can have a one to one relationship using the @OneToOne annotation, and the association will be owned by the first entity class by the end of the association.

@RestResource annotation is optional and can be used to customize the endpoint. Make sure to have different names for each association resource.

To expose these entities as resources, create two repository interfaces for each of them, by extending the CrudRepository interface.

To create the resources add an instance, and have the API return the JSON object. Next send a GET request to the endpoint, whichwill return an empty object. Create the association using the HTTP method PUT and a body containing the URI of the resource to bind to the association. If you need to remove an association, we can call the endpoint with DELETE method.

One-to-many relationship - defined using the @OneToMany and @ManyToOne annotations and can have the optional @RestResource annotation to customize the association resource

Many-to-Many Relationship

Many-to-many relationship - defined using @ManyToMany annotation, to which we can add @RestResource.

## Integration Testing in Spring

`Spring MVC Test Configuration`

We can enable an extension interface by adding the @ExtendWith annotation to our test classes and specifying the extension class to load. To run the Spring test, we use SpringExtension.class.

We also need the @ContextConfiguration annotation to load the context configuration and bootstrap the context that our test will use.

Finally, we also annotate the test with @WebAppConfiguration, which will load the web application context.
