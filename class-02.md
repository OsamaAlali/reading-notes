Chapter 4

operation oprators :

    which used to compare values and test if condition met or not .like(=,>,<.etc)

• == is Equal != not Equal

• === strict equal (the value and datatype must equal then return True)

• !== strict not Equal (the value and datatype must not equal then return True)

• Structure condition: in bracts (first operand (comparison operators like >=)second operand )

To component to bulid decision

    Evaluation condition which return True or False value. Like IF(6>=10)
    Conditional statement which it means if the condition met the execute code Ex: if (5>10) {alert (“code will execute here if condition True”) } Else { Alert (“code will execute here if condition False”)) } comparison operator usually return single values Logical operator allow to compart result more than one comparison operators. And like && : if (age >16 && age <30) OR like || : if (age >16 ||age <30) Nor like ! ::: !(1==5);

LOOP

To execute a set of code in one block until condition not met and to reduced redundant code

    3 type of loop
      1.  For: used when the iteration (time ) know. like print ur Name 10 time. For (initialization, condition ,update) { set of code, }

    2. while :used if we not know the # of iteration . While(condtion) { Execute code }

    3.do..While:is the same while the key different is the code will execute at least one time . Do{ Execute code at least 1 before checking condition }while();
