## Java Primitives versus Objects

- java has a two-fold type system consisting of primitives such as int, Boolean and reference types such as Integer, Boolean. Every primitive type corresponds to a reference type
- `wrapper classes`: using to work with collection replace primitives

autoboxing : is converting a primitive type to a reference one

`primitive type variables:`

• boolean – 1 bit

• byte – 8 bits

• short, char – 16 bits

• int, float – 32 bits
• long, double – 64 bits

`wrapper classes:`

• Boolean – 128 bits

• Byte – 128 bits
• Short, Character – 128 bits
• Integer, Float – 128 bits
• Long, Double – 192 bits

## Exceptions

- `What Is an Exception?`
An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions
- When an error occurs within a method, the method creates an object and hands it off to the runtime system. The object, called an exception object, contains information about the error, including its type and the state of the program when the error occurred. Creating an exception object and handing it to the runtime system is called throwing an exception

- `The Catch or Specify Requirement`
- A try statement that catches the exception. The try must provide a handler for the exception,
- A method that specifies that it can throw the exception. The method must provide a throws clause that lists the exception,
- )
# Catching and Handling Exceptions:
  -(java.io.FileReader, java.io.FileNotFoundException, Error, RuntimeException, java.io.IOError, RuntimeException

- Try used to hold expected error
- Catch used to display that’s error
- Try{
- }catch(){6
- }Finllaly{
Sut(‘’’’);
- }

## Scanning

- Its used get data from user

• must import this packge import java.util.Scanner;
• public class ScanXan {
•     public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
• 
•         Scanner s = null;
• 
•         try {
•             s = new Scanner(new BufferedReader(new FileReader("xanadu.txt")));
• 
•             while (s.hasNext()) {
•                 System.out.println(s.next());
•             }
•         } finally {
•             if (s != null) {
•                 s.close();
•             }
•         }
•     }
• }
