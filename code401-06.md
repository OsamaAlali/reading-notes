Interfaces

There are a number of situations in software engineering when it is important for disparate groups of programmers 
to agree to a "contract" that spells out how their software interacts. Each group should be able to write their code without
 any knowledge of how the other group's code is written. Generally speaking, interfaces are such contracts.

For example, imagine a futuristic society where computer-controlled robotic cars
 transport passengers through city streets without a human operator. Automobile manufacturers write software (Java, of course) that operates the automobile—stop, start, accelerate, turn left,
 and so forth. Another industrial group, electronic guidance instrument manufacturers, make computer systems that receive GPS (Global Positioning System) position data and wireless transmission of 
traffic conditions and use that information to drive the car.

## Inheritance:
 A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, 
or child class). The class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent class).

The idea of inheritance is simple but powerful: When you want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that
 you want, you can derive your new class from the existing class. In doing this, 
you can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class without having to write (and debug!) them yourself.

A subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from its superclass. Constructors are not members,
 so they are not inherited by subclasses, but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.

## What You Can Do in a Subclass

A subclass inherits all of the public and protected members of its parent, no matter what package the subclass is in. If the subclass is in the same package as its parent, it also inherits the package-private members of the parent. You can use the inherited members as is, replace them, hide them, or supplement them with new members:

    The inherited fields can be used directly, just like any other fields.
    You can declare a field in the subclass with the same name as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it (not recommended).
    You can declare new fields in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
    The inherited methods can be used directly as they are.
    You can write a new instance method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus overriding it.
    You can write a new static method in the subclass that has the same signature as the one in the superclass, thus hiding it.
    You can declare new methods in the subclass that are not in the superclass.
    You can write a subclass constructor that invokes the constructor of the superclass, either implicitly or by using the keyword super.

## Private Members in a Superclass

A subclass does not inherit the private members of its parent class. However, if the superclass has public or protected methods for accessing its private fields, these can also be used by the subclass.

A nested class has access to all the private members of its enclosing class—both fields and methods. Therefore, a public or protected nested class inherited by a subclass has indirect access to all of the private members of the superclass.
