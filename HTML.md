- HTML pages are text documents.
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled 
brackets) to give the information they surround special 
meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes 
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes 
the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more 
about the content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.
