## Linked Lists

-	A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

### `Array VS  Linked Lists:`
> -	`Array` : locate fixed location in memory for array length, 

> - `Linked Lists` is not node store random in memory each one will point to next 

1.	`Linked` `List` - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.

2.	`Singly` - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

3.	`Doubly` - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.

4.	`Node` - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.

5.	`Next` - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.

6.	`Head` - The Head is a reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.

	`Current` - The Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. When traversing, you create a new Current variable at the Head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.


## linear data structures:
which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed.

## non-linear data structures:
 items donâ€™t have to be arranged in order, which means that we could traverse the data structure non-sequentially.
