The HttpUrlConnection class allows us to perform basic HTTP requests without the use of any additional libraries. All the classes that we need are part of the java.net package.
The disadvantages of using this method are that the code can be more cumbersome than other HTTP libraries and that it does not provide more advanced functionalities such as dedicated methods for adding headers or authentication.

We can create an HttpUrlConnection instance using the openConnection() method of the URL class. Note that this method only creates a connection object but doesn't establish the connection yet.
The HttpUrlConnection class is used for all types of requests by setting the requestMethod attribute to one of the values: GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, TRACE.
Let's create a connection to a given URL using GET method:
Adding Request Parameters:

Setting Request Headers


Configuring Timeouts:
HttpUrlConnection class allows setting the connect and read timeouts. These values define the interval of time to wait for the connection to the server to be established or data to be available for reading.


Handling Cookies:

The java.net package contains classes that ease working with cookies such as CookieManager and HttpCookie.
read the cookies from a response, we can retrieve the value of the Set-Cookie header and parse it to a list of HttpCookie objects.

`Handling Redirects`

`Reading the Response`

`Reading the Response on Failed Requests`
