## Tree 

Common Terminology

 `Node` - A Tree node is a component which may contain itâ€™s own values, and references to other nodes

 `Root` - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
 K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.

 `Left` - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree

 `Right` - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree

 `Edge` - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node`.

 `Leaf` - A leaf is a node that does not have any children.

 `Height `- The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf.

## Depth First:

 - Pre-order: root >> left >> right
 - In-order: left >> root >> right
 -  Post-order: left >> right  root

 ## Breadth First:

 - Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.
