>Create a Resource Representation Class:

- The service will accept messages that contain a name in a STOMP message whose body is a JSON object.

- Upon receiving the message and extracting the name, the service will process it by creating a greeting and publishing that greeting on a separate queue to which the client is subscribed. The greeting will also be a JSON object.

- To model the message that carries the name, you can create a plain old Java object with a name property and a corresponding getName() method.



> Create a Message-handling Controller:

- In Springâ€™s approach to working with STOMP messaging, STOMP messages can be routed to @Controller classes.

- Internally, the implementation of the method simulates a processing delay by causing the thread to sleep for one second.
