## Spring Security Architecture

- Authentication and Access Control:

> Application security boils down to two more or less independent problems: authentication (who are you?) and authorization (what are you allowed to do?). Sometimes people say “access control” instead of "authorization", which can get confusing, but it can be helpful to think of it that way because “authorization” is overloaded in other places. Spring Security has an architecture that is designed to separate authentication from authorization and has strategies and extension points for both.

>public interface AuthenticationManager {
  >>Authentication authenticate(Authentication authentication)
    throws AuthenticationException;
}

## Spring Auth Cheat Sheet
> Step 1: set up a user model and repo

>Step 2: create a controller for that model

>Step 3: UserDetailsServiceImpl implements UserDetailsService gets a User from the database by username (make sure your repository has the method to make this easy!)

>Step 4: ApplicationUser implements UserDetails
use IntelliJ to implement the methods; make the boolean ones all return true

>Step 5: WebSecurityConfig extendsWebSecurityConfigurerAdapter

- has a UserDetailsService
- passwordEncoder bean
>  configure AuthManagerBuilder
       >> auth.userDetailsService(userDetailsService).passwordEncoder(passwordEncoder());

- configure HttpSecurity

> cors? csrf?

> matchers for URLs that are allowed

>>ensure that login and signup URLs allowed; also consider homepage etc.

- formLogin with login page set up
- logout

    @Override
    @Bean
    public AuthenticationManager authenticationManagerBean() throws Exception {
        return super.authenticationManagerBean();
    }
>Step 6: registration page

-create it w/ form
-  ensure it posts to a route your controller is ready for
   
- check it's saving in the DB

    // maybe autologin?
    Authentication authentication = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(newUser, null, new ArrayList<>());
    SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authentication);
