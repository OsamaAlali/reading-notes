- @RequestMapping :
  > @RequestMapping — by Path: @RequestMapping(value = "/ex/foos", method = RequestMethod.GET)
  > @RequestMapping — the HTTP Method

  -  RequestMapping and HTTP Headers:
    > @RequestMapping With the headers Attribute
    > @RequestMapping Consumes and Produces
    > RequestMapping With Path Variables

     > RequestMapping With Request Parameters

    > RequestMapping Corner Cases
   > New Request Mapping Shortcuts

  ## Spring Data Repositories

Let's start with the JpaRepository – which extends PagingAndSortingRepository and, in turn, the CrudRepository.

Each of these defines its own functionality:

    CrudRepository provides CRUD functions
    PagingAndSortingRepository provides methods to do pagination and sort records
    JpaRepository provides JPA related methods such as flushing the persistence context and delete records in a batch

And so, because of this inheritance relationship, the JpaRepository contains the full API of CrudRepository and PagingAndSortingRepository.

## CrudRepository


    save(…) – save an Iterable of entities. Here, we can pass multiple objects to save them in a batch

    findOne(…) – get a single entity based on passed primary key value

    findAll() – get an Iterable of all available entities in database

    count() – return the count of total entities in a table

    delete(…) – delete an entity based on the passed object

    exists(…) – verify if an entity exists based on the passed primary key value
