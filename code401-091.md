Stacks and Queues


A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

1.	Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
2.	Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
3.	Top - This is the top of the stack.
4.	Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
5.	IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

Queues (FIFO) First In First Out
Stacks(LIFO  OR FILO) Last In First Out
