>Flowchart:the diamond shape represents appoint where the diction  must be made and the code can take one or more than 1 path.
#### compartion oprators :
* which used to compare values and test if condition met or not .like(=,>,<.etc)
-	`== `is Equal       `!=` not Equal
-	`===` strict equal (the value and datatype must equal then return True)
-	`!==` strict not Equal (the value and datatype must not equal then return True)
-	**_Structure condition_**: in bracts (`first operand` (`comparison operators` like >=)`second operand `)
To component to bulid  decision 
1.	Evaluation condition which return True or False value. Like IF(6>=10)
2.	Conditional statement which it means if the condition met the execute code 
Ex: if (5>10)
{alert (“code will execute here if condition True”) }
Else
{
Alert (“code will execute here if condition False”))
}
>>### comparison operator usually return single values  Logical operator allow to compart result  more than one comparison operators.
And like &&  : if (age >16 && age <30)
OR like || : if (age >16 ||age <30)
Nor like ! :::   !(1==5);

>### LOOP
To execute a set of code in one block until condition not met and to reduced redundant code
3 type of loop 
1.	`For`: used  when the iteration (time ) know. like print ur  Name 10 time.
>For (initialization, condition ,update)
>>{   set of code,  }

2 . `while` :used if we not know the # of iteration .
>  While(condtion)
{
>Execute code
}

3.`do..While`:is the same while the key different is the code will execute at least one time .

>**Do**{
Execute code at least 1 before checking condition
>}**while()**;
