## Android Developers:

> An Android package, which is an archive file with an .apk suffix, contains the contents of an Android app that are required at runtime and it is the file that Android-powered devices use to install the app.

## App components:

- Activities: An activity is the entry point for interacting with the user. It represents a single screen with a user interface.

- Services:A service is a general-purpose entry point for keeping an app running in the background for all kinds of reasons. It is a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations or to perform work for remote processes.

- Broadcast receivers:s a component that enables the system to deliver events to the app outside of a regular user flow, allowing the app to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements.

- Content providers: shared set of app data that you can store in the file system, in a SQLite database, on the web, or on any other persistent storage location that your app can access. Through the content provider, other apps can query or modify the data if the content provider allows it.

## The manifest file:
  all components will be inside this file because the start app will start from it ;
