## Functional Programming Concepts
1.	What is functional programming? Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

2.	What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function? It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)and It does not cause any observable side effects


3.	What are the benefits of a pure function? stable, consistent, and predictable, code’s definitely easier to test

4.	What is immutability? Unchanging over time or unable to be changed
5.	What is Referential transparency? function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
