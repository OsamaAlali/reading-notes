`Layout:`
-`Building Blocks`: start on a new line, h1 ,p, ul ,li .

-`inline elements`: flow in between surrounding text img,b,i

containing or parent (outer box): one block-level element sits inside another block-level element
-`positioning schemes`: hat allow you to control the layout of a page:
 1-`Normal flow`: Every block-level element appears on a new line
 2- `Relative Positioning`: This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed
3-'absolute positioning':This positions the element in relation to its containing element. It is taken out of normal flow, meaning that it does not affect the position of a:ny surrounding elements
4-`Fixed Positioning`: This is a form of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window, as opposed to the containing element.
5-`floating Elements`: Floating an element allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box
-`z-index property`: allows you to control which box appears on top

                                              JavaScript

>to called function   nameFunction ();
