## Tasks and Back Stack

>task: is a collection of activities that users interact with when performing a certain job.
The activities are arranged in a stack.

>The device Home screen is the starting place for most tasks.

>When an activity stops, the system retains the current state of its user interface.Because the activities in the back stack are never rearranged, if your app allows users to start a 
particular activity from more than one activity, a new instance of that activity is created and pushed onto the stack

> If the user presses the Back button, the current activity is popped from the stack and destroyed. The previous activity in the stack is resumed.

> A task is a cohesive unit that can move to the “background” when users begin a new task or go to the Home screen.

> The activities in the back stack are never rearranged, if your app allows users to start a particular activity from more than one activity, a new instance of that activity is created and pushed onto the stack.

> Managing Tasks - Android manages tasks and the back stack by placing all activities started in succession in the same task and in a “last in, first out” stack.


## Android SharedPreferences:

> f you have a relatively small collection of key-values that you'd like to save, you should use the SharedPreferences APIs. A SharedPreferences object points to a file containing key-value pairs and provides simple methods to read and write them. Each SharedPreferences file is managed by the framework and can be private or shared.

> create a new shared preference file or access an existing by :

- getSharedPreferences().

- getPreferences().
